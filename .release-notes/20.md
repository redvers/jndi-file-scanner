## Brought application up to date with Modern Pony

This application was written many years ago in order to rapidly assess
java artifacts for jndi / log4j.  This release brings up up-to-date
with modern Pony.

## Release now generates statically linked executable

In this release we have implemented github workflows to generate a
static executable which can be used on any Linux distribution.

This is so we don't have to maintain multiple executable packages
for multiple distributions and versions.
